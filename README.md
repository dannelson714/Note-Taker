# Note-Taker

## Description

In this project I was tasked with establishing the back-end functionality for a note taking app, the front-end code for which I was already provided. I used Express.js to save and retrieve node data from JSON files. In addition, I used the program Insomnia to test my server endpoints and connections, as well as Heroku for a deployment of my code.
